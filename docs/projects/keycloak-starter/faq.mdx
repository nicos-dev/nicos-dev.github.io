### Issuers

An issuer is the keycloak-instance where the Token was requested e.g. http://*host:port*/auth/realms/*realm*

This information is saved in the **iss** claim in bearer-token
```json
{
  "iss": "http://docker-machine:3000/auth/realms/<realm>"
}
```


:::info Information
If you're requesting a token at http://keycloak.nicos-dev.com/auth and checking the token in internal docker-network via
http://keycloak:3000/auth/realms/*realm*/protocol/openid-connect/certs you must add both hosts to the issuers property:

```yaml
# application.yml

keycloak-starter:
  oauth:
    issuers:
      - http://keycloak.nicos-dev.com/auth/realms/<realm>
      - http://keycloak:3000/auth/realms/<realm>
```
